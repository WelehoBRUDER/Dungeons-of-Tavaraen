### What is modding?

Modding is the process of adding new features to the game.<br>
This guide will help you to understand how to install mods or make your own.<br>
Mods can range from small changes like adding a new item to the game to large changes like adding a new class or a complete overhaul of the game.<br>

#### Something to note

> Playing with mods will involve always opening the folder where they are installed.<br>
> This is due to browser security restrictions, which prevent the game from accessing files outside of its own directory.<br>
> All changes you make in the mod loader will be remembered by the broswer, so you won't have to do it again.<br>

### Installing mods
